# [Machine Learning Scripting](https://github.com/ashioyajotham/ML-Algorithms/blob/main/ML%20Scripting.ipynb)
* General machine learning practices
* For our first file, we use the `IRIS` dataset, considered as the "hello world" of machine learning to classify flowers in Python through the command-line.
  It is basically similar to using Jupyter notebooks but slightly different in syntax and easier.
* The machine learning algorithms include:
         - `Support Vector Machine (SVM)`
         - `KNeighbors Classifier (KNN)`
         - `Decision Tree Classifier (CART)`
         - `Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)`
         - `Logistic Regression (LR)`
         - `Gaussian Naive Bayes (NB)`
        
 * The evaluation metrics include:
         - `Accuracy Score`
         - `Confusion Matrix`
         - `Classification Report`

* Model generalization performance:
         - `StratifiedKFold`




#[Modelling Non-Linear Features-Target Relationship](https://github.com/ashioyajotham/ML-Algorithms/blob/main/linear-regression-non-linear-btn-data-and-target.ipynb)
* Linear regression with non-linear link between data and target
* The deployment of scikit-learn in linear models in this case, Linear Regression
* Machine learning modelling alogorithms:
         - Linear Regression
         - Decision Tree Regressor
         
* Dealing with non-linearity;
        i) choose a model that can natively deal with non-linearity,
       ii) engineer a richer set of features by including expert knowledge which can
                be directly used by a simple linear model, or
      iii) use a "kernel" to have a locally-based decision function instead of a
            global linear decision function.
