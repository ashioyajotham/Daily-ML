*A short form of else if
*Used to check more than just one condition and to stop when the first statement which is true is found

if weather_is_good:
    go_for_a_walk()
elif tickets are available:
    go_to_the theater()
elif table_is_available:
    go_to_lunch()
else:
   play_chess_at_home()

*The way to assemble subsequent if-elif-else statements is sometimes called a cascade.
