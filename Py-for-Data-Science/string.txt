Strings are used when you need to process text(like names of all kinds, addresses, novels etc) not numbers
*A qoute preceded by a backlash(escape character) changes it's meaning- it's not a delimiter but just a quote
*If you open a string with a quote end it with a quote but if you open it with an apostrophe end it with an apostrophe
