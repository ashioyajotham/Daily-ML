*Most programming languages allow you to assign a name to a code block that performs a concrete computation. These named blocks can be reused quickly because you can use their name to call them from different places in your code. Programmers call these named blocks subroutines, procedures or functions depending on the language.
*In general, a procedure is a named code block that performs a set of actions w/o computing a final value or result while a function is named code block that performs some actions with the purpose of computing a final value or result, which is then sent back to the caller code.
