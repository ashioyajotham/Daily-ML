*It comes from the obserrvation that sometimes it is more important to count the turns of the loop than to count the condition ie

for i in range(100):
    #do something
    pass

*The range() function may be equippped with  arguements
 i)the first determines the initial value of the control variable
ii)the last shows the first value the control variable will not be assigned, the increment(step)

*The range() function accepts only integers as its arguments and generates sequences of integers

The range () function generates a sequence of numbers. It accepts integers and returns range objects.
The syntax of range() is as follows: range(start, stop, step) where
               start - optional parameter specifying the starting number 
                       of the sequence(0 by default)
               stop -  an optional parameter specifying the end of the sequence generated(it is not included)
               step - an optional parameter specifying the difference between the numbers in the sequence
                      (1 by default)
