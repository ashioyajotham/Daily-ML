*Another python data structure. It is not a sequence type (but can easily be adapted to sequence processing) and it is mutable(changeable) and indexed collections of data.
*In Python's world, the word you look for is named key and the word you get from the dictionary is called a value ie the dictionary is aset of key-value pairs. ie
     my_dictonary = {
       key1: value1,
       key2: value2,
       key3: value3,
       }

 i)Each key must be unique - it's not possible to have more than one key of the same value
ii)A key may be any immutable type of object: it can be a number(integer or float), or even a string, but not a list
iii)a dictionary is not a list - a list contains a set of numbered values while a dictionary holds a pair of values
iv)the len() function works in a dictionary too - it returns the number of key-value elements in the dictionary
v)dictionary is a one - way tool - if you have an English - French dictionary, you can look for French equivalents of English terms but not vice versa  

#If you want to access a dictionary item, you can do so by making a reference to its key inside a pair of square brackets(ex.1) or by using the get() method;

pol_eng_dictionary = {
    "kwiat": "flower"
    "woda" : "water"
    "gleba": "soil"
    }

item_1 = pol_eng_dictionary["gleba"]
print(item_1)

item_2 = pol_eng_dictionary.get("woda")
print(item_2)
