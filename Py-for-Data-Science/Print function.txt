1. What is the effect the print() function causes?

  *takes its arguments (it may accept more than one argument and may also accept less than one argument)
  *converts them into human-readable form if needed (as you may suspect, strings don't require this action, as the string    is already readable)
  *and sends the resulting data to the output device (usually the console); in other words, anything you put into the    print() function will appear on your screen.

2. What arguments does print() expect?

   Any. Print() is able to operate with virtually all types of data offered by Python. Strings, numbers, characters, logical values, objects -    any of these may be    successfully passed to print().

3. What value does the print() function return?

  None. Its effect is enough.

A line can be empty (i.e., it may contain no instruction at all) but it must not contain two, three or more instructions. This is strictly prohibited.

Note: Python makes one exception to this rule - it allows one instruction to spread across more than one line (which may be helpful when your code contains complex constructions).

* The backslash (\) has a very special meaning when used inside strings - this is called the escape character.The word escape should be understood specifically - it  means that the series of characters in the string escapes for the moment (a very short moment) to introduce a special inclusion.The word escape should be understood  specifically - it means that the series of characters in the string escapes for the moment (a very short moment) to introduce a special inclusion.The letter n placed  after the backslash comes from the word newline.Both the backslash and the n form a special symbol named a newline character, which urges the console to start a new  output line.

sep= Controls what to be printed between items


end= Introduced in Python 3.It dictates what should be printed after all arguements have been printed. By default its value is a new line ie \n 

N/B*The end and sep parameters can be used for formatting the output of the print function
