Rules for naming a variable
 i)the name of the vaia ble must consist of upper-case or lower case letters, digits and underscore
 ii)the name of the variable must be begin with a letter
**The undescore is a letter
iii)Upper and lower cases are treated as different eg ALICE and alice
iv)Must not be a keyword


Keyword/reserved keywords ie reserved bc you can't use them as names examples: True, False, None, and, as, assert, break, class, del, continue, else, except, finally, def, from, global, if, import, in, lambda, nonlocal, or, pass, raise, return, try, while, with, yield
Fortunately, python is  case-sensitive hence you can modify any of these words by changing the case of any letter thus creating a new word which is not reserved anymore eg Import
