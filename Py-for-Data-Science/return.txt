*To get functions to return values you use the return function

***************************return w/o an expression***************************************************
*When used inside a function, it causes the immediate termination of the function's execution, and an instant return (hence the name) to the point of invocation
N/B*If a function is not intended to produce a result, using the return instruction is not obligatory - it will be executed
    implicitly at the end of the function
   *Anyway, you can use it to terminate a function's activities on demand before the control reaches the control reaches 
    the control reaches the function's last line
