1         +,-       unary
2         **        
3         *,/,//,%
4         +,-       binary

*Unary - have one operator eg -1, or +3
*binary - have two operators eg 4 + 5, or 12 % 5
*floor/integer division - returns a number resulting from division, but rounded down to the nearest whole number eg 3 // 2.0 = 1.0
