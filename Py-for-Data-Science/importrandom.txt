# Random delivers some mechanisms allowing you to operate
# with pseudorandom numbers (pseudo - the numbers generated may look 
# random in a sense you can't predict their 
#  subsequent values)

# A random number generator takes a value called a seed, treats it as an input value
# calculates a "random" number based on it (the method depends on a chosen algorithm)
# and produces a new seed value.

# The random factor of the process may be augmented by setting the seed
# with a number taken from the current time - this may ensure that each program
# launch will start from a different seed value(ergo, it will use different seed numbers)

# The length of a cycle in which all seed values are unique may be very long but not infinite;
# sooner or later the seed values will start repeating  and the generating values will repeat too.
