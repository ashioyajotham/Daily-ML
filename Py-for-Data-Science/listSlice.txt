Syntax: lst[ Initial : End : IndexJump]
Slice can take three parameters:
   *start(optional) - starting integer where the slicing of the object starts.
                      Default to none if not provided
   *stop -integer until which the slicing takes place. The slicing stops at indexstop -1
          (last element)
   *step(optional) - integer value which determines the increment  
                    between each index for slicing. Defaults to none if not provided.
                     
Slicing  can be used both with positive indexes as well as negative indexes
One heuristic is , for a slice from zero to n, think: "Zero is the beginning, start at the 
beginning and take n items in a list."

*************Rules of Slicing*************************
#Since slicing returns a list, slice assignment requires a list
#The assigned list (iterable) doesn't have to have the same length; the indexed
 is simply sliced out and replaced en masse by whateverv is beng assigned
