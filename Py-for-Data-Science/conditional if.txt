*Conditionally executed statements have to be indented ie 
       if sheep_counter >= 120:
           make_a_bed()
           take_a_shower()
      feed_the_sheepdogs()

*Feed_the_sheepdogs is executed unconditionally when sheep_count reaches the desirsble outcome ie not indented and does not belong to the if block.
