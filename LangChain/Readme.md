## LangChain
* LangChain is a framework for building complex LLM powered apps. It is a Python-based framework for chaining together different methods to interact with LLMs. It was developed by Harrison Chase to reduce the complexity of developing applications with LLMs, making it easier for developers to create powerful applications.

* Ways to utilize it:
  - LLM app to take action
  - Bring your own data
