"""
Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
Output: [1,2]
Example 3:

Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
Output: [0,1]
 

Constraints:

2 <= nums.length <= 104
-109 <= nums[i] <= 109
-109 <= target <= 109
Only one valid answer exists.
 

Follow-up: Can you come up with an algorithm that is less than O(n2) time complexity?
"""
# Action Plan
# 1. Create a dictionary to store the number and its index.
# 2. Traverse through the list and check if the difference between the target and the number is in the dictionary.
# 3. If it is, return the index of the number and the index of the difference.
# 4. If it is not, add the number to the dictionary.
# 5. If no solution exists, return None.
