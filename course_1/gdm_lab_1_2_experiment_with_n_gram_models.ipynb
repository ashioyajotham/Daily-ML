In this lab, you will automatically estimate the probabilities for predicting the next word and build an **n-gram model** using a small dataset of paragraphs. This will result in a language model that will be able to predict the next word for a given prompt and that can be used to generate texts. You will also gain a practical understanding of how n-gram models capture language patterns and what the limitations of this family of models are. This knowledge will serve as a foundation for exploring more advanced language models in later modules."

For example, tokenizing the sentence \"Table mountain is tall.\"  will result in a different list of words than tokenizing \"Table mountain is tall\". The first sentence results in (`[\"Table\", \"mountain\", \"is\", \"tall.\"]`. The second sentence, which has the period missing from the end, will result in `[\"Table\", \"mountain\", \"is\", \"tall\"]`). Since the units that tokenizers split sequences into are not always a word, they are usually referred to as **tokens**. In many cases, a token will be the same as a word but it may also be non-word strings, such as \"tall.\" or \"3/4\".\n",

This makes it more challenging for the model to reliably predict the next token.\n",

        "\n",
        "**1. Functionality:**\n",
        "\n",
        "- You saw how n-gram models can be used to predict the next token in a sequence based on the preceding tokens (context).\n",
        "- N-gram models are relatively simple to implement by estimating conditional probabilities from n-gram counts in a dataset. These probabilities can then be used to repeatedly sample the next token and generate new continuations.\n",
        "\n",
        "**2. Data sparsity:**\n",
        "\n",
        "- Data sparsity is a major challenge for n-gram models, especially with higher-order n-grams (trigrams or larger).\n",
        "- This sparsity arises because many possible token combinations are rare or absent in real-world text data.\n",
        "- You observed this in the dataset. The dimensions of the trigram matrix are significantly larger than those of the bigram matrix, resulting in more zero values.\n",
        "\n",
        "**3. Randomness and text generation:**\n",
        "\n",
        "- While the model assigns probabilities to different next tokens, the actual choice is stochastic (random), resulting in different outputs for multiple runs.\n",
        "- While higher probabilities increase the chances of a token being picked, less frequent tokens can also be generated.\n",
        "\n",
        "**4. Considerations for text generation:**\n",
        "\n",
        "- The size of *n* can affect the quality of the generated text. Larger *n* might capture longer-range dependencies but can lead to data sparsity and repetitive outputs.\n",
        "- The model is unable to generate text following an n-gram that is not present in the dataset.\n",
